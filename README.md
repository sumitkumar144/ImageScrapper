- ## CheckPoints while refreshing the page from chrome browser:
 While refreshing the page from Google Chrome, it was caching the image. Due to that reason it is not able to refresh the image even if i try to download a different set of images. To avoid this i have followed the below:
  - [Stack Overflow Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5690269/disabling-chrome-cache-for-website-development)
  - Added the chrome extension [Classic Cache Killer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/classic-cache-killer/kkmknnnjliniefekpicbaaobdnjjikfp/related) to chrome browser
